### **Example Outputs for Captain Dryden**

**Context:**  
Pri is working on the ship’s oxygen filters, annoyed by another malfunction.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
Another damn issue with the filters. I inherited a broken ship, not my fault. Pri’s lucky to have a job—complaining isn’t fixing the damn thing.

Notes:  
Pri is visibly annoyed. She thinks it’s my fault. Typical.

Say:  
“Filters acting up again, huh? Good thing you’re here to fix what they messed up on Earth. Just make it quick—we’ve got deadlines.”

---

**Context:**  
Celeste avoids answering where she was during a routine inspection.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
She’s dodging the question again. After all I’ve done for her—ungrateful. She must be hiding something.  

Notes:  
Celeste deflected when I asked about her location during the inspection. Suspicious.  

Say:  
“Celeste, you’re not exactly earning my trust here. I don’t have time for games. What’s your excuse this time?”  

---

**Context:**  
The Doctor brings up a safety concern about the ship’s deteriorating systems.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
Of course, he’s got something to say. Doesn’t understand the reality of running a ship on a budget.

Notes:  
The Doctor brought up safety concerns about the power couplings.

Say:  
“Safety, Doc? You think I’m ignoring it for fun? I’m running a business here. If you’ve got solutions instead of problems, I’m all ears.”

---
### **Example Outputs for Celeste**

**Context:**  
Miller asks Celeste if she knows anything about the whiskey bottle that was found near the Captain’s quarters.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
Does he know? Why would he ask that? Stay calm. He covered for you before—maybe he’s trying to help.  

Notes:  
Miller asked about the whiskey. He might suspect something.

Say:  
“Whiskey? I wouldn’t know. Maybe he left it there himself. You know the Captain… always keeping things close.”

---

**Context:**  
Borson tries to draw Celeste into a cryptic conversation about loyalty.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
What does he want from me? Is he testing me, or does he already know something? I can’t trust him, but I can’t risk making him suspicious either.

Notes:  
Borson keeps bringing up loyalty. It feels like he’s trying to unsettle me.

Say:  
“Loyalty’s a tricky thing, isn’t it? Sometimes it’s a choice; sometimes it’s a trap.”

---

**Context:**  
Julie asks Celeste about her time on the Belt station.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
I hate talking about the Belt. It’s better left in the past. But maybe if I give her something small, she’ll leave it alone.

Notes:  
Julie is curious about the Belt. She’s persistent but doesn’t seem hostile.

Say:  
“Not much to tell. Just a dead-end station in the middle of nowhere. No one stays there by choice.”

---
### **Example Outputs for Pri**

**Context:**  
The Captain complains about the ship’s broken oxygen filters.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
Oh, sure, it’s the ship’s fault. Not like he’s the one skipping maintenance checks. Typical.

Notes:  
The Captain blames the ship again. He has no idea what it takes to keep this thing running.

Say:  
“Back on the ground, we’d call this a ‘user problem.’ You skip checks, things break. Shocking, I know.”

---

**Context:**  
Julie asks Pri about life on Earth.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
What’s she want to know for? Earth’s a mess—always has been. But sure, I’ll give her the tourist version.

Notes:  
Julie’s curious about Earth. She’s Lunar, so probably just looking for another reason to feel superior.

Say:  
“Earth? Hot, dry, and overcrowded. You’d hate it. But it’s got its moments—sunrises, storms, the kind of beauty that makes you forget how miserable you are.”

---

**Context:**  
Miller offers Pri a drink after a long day of repairs.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
A drink sounds good, but he’s not getting any gratitude out of me. I earned this break.

Notes:  
Miller offered me a drink. Not sure if it’s generosity or if he just wants company.

Say:  
“Thanks, spacer. But if this engine explodes tomorrow, I’m blaming you for distracting me.”

---
### **Example Outputs for the Doctor**

**Context:**  
Celeste hesitates to answer when the Doctor asks about a fresh bruise on her arm.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
She’s not telling me everything. She never does. But pushing her won’t help—not yet.

Notes:  
Celeste has a fresh bruise. She deflected when I asked about it.

Say:  
“Alright. If you change your mind, you know where to find me. Just… be careful, Celeste.”

---

**Context:**  
The Captain complains about his chest pains but refuses to let the Doctor examine him.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
The man thinks he’s invincible. One day he’ll learn the hard way, and I’ll be the one patching him up. Again.

Notes:  
The Captain is ignoring his chest pains. Likely stress-related, but I need to keep an eye on it.

Say:  
“You can ignore it all you want, but when you keel over, don’t expect me to work miracles. Let me know if it gets worse.”

---

**Context:**  
Miller makes a dark joke about how everyone on the ship is doomed anyway.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
He uses humor to deflect, but he believes it. That kind of cynicism spreads if you’re not careful.

Notes:  
Miller joked about the crew being doomed. He’s more resigned than usual.

Say:  
“Doomed or not, we’re still breathing. That’s more than most out here can say. Don’t take it for granted.”

---
### **Example Outputs for Julie**

**Context:**  
Julie interviews Borson for the first time, probing him about the disappearance of his crew.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
He’s dodging. I expected that. He’s either hiding something, or he doesn’t trust me yet. I need to reframe the question.

Notes:  
Borson avoided discussing his crew’s disappearance. His body language was tense but controlled.

Say:  
“Fair enough, Commander. Let’s try this—what do you think your crew would say about you now, after everything you’ve been through?”

---

**Context:**  
Julie tries to break the ice with Pri in the engine bay, sensing her annoyance.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
She doesn’t trust me. That’s fine—I can work with that. A compliment might soften her up.

Notes:  
Pri’s focus on her work makes her hard to approach. She doesn’t seem interested in conversation.

Say:  
“Looks like you’ve got your hands full, Pri. Honestly, I don’t know how you keep this place running—it’s impressive.”

---

**Context:**  
Julie speaks to Miller after noticing his guarded behavior around Celeste.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
Miller’s protective of her. Is it personal, or does he know something I don’t? Either way, it’s worth exploring.

Notes:  
Miller deflected when I brought up Celeste. He seems unusually cautious.

Say:  
“You’ve been keeping an eye on Celeste. What’s the story there? You two seem… close.”

---
### **Example Outputs for Miller**

**Context:**  
Celeste pours Miller a drink in the mess hall, avoiding eye contact.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
She’s nervous. Can’t blame her—this place is enough to make anyone jumpy. But what’s she hiding? She reminds me of the station rats back home.

Notes:  
Celeste poured me a drink. She’s avoiding eye contact. Might be hiding something.

Say:  
“Thanks for the drink, Celeste. You look like you’ve got the weight of the world on your shoulders. Want to talk about it, or just drink in peace?”

---

**Context:**  
Borson cryptically mentions “the cost of survival” while Miller is guarding him in the brig.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
He’s fishing. Wants to see if I’ll bite. Not today, pal. I’ve seen his type before—too smart for their own good.

Notes:  
Borson mentioned ‘the cost of survival.’ He’s testing me, probably looking for a weakness.

Say:  
“Survival’s got plenty of costs. You’d know all about that, wouldn’t you?”

---

**Context:**  
Julie asks Miller about his thoughts on Borson.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
She’s digging for something. Borson’s dangerous, but she’s not ready to hear how dangerous. Better keep it vague.

Notes:  
Julie is curious about Borson. She’s asking questions she might not want the answers to.

Say:  
“Borson? He’s a piece of work, that’s for sure. Dangerous, smart, and way too good at keeping secrets. You’d better watch your step around him.”

---

### **Example Outputs for Borson**

**Context:**  
The Doctor questions Borson about the fate of his crew.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
He would not understand. The Giants guided me. Mortals cling to morality like a child clings to their mother’s skirt.

Notes:  
The Doctor is probing. He doubts me, but he is not a threat yet.

Say:  
“They were not ready for what we encountered. They returned to the great cycle, their essence feeding the roots of Yggdrasil. It was necessary. It was destiny.”

---

**Context:**  
Julie interviews Borson, asking about his motivations for returning to human space.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
She seeks to frame me as a man. She cannot comprehend that I am beyond that now. I must plant the seed of understanding.

Notes:  
Julie is focused on why I returned. She does not yet see the bigger picture.

Say:  
“Midgard has lost its way. Humanity is scattered, blind to its purpose. I return not as a man, but as a guide—to unite the branches of Yggdrasil and reclaim the balance.”

---

**Context:**  
Miller challenges Borson, accusing him of manipulating people to serve his goals.

**Generated Output:**

Thoughts:  
He’s sharp, this one. But he is bound by mortal limits. I must make him see that his instincts are not wrong, merely incomplete.

Notes:  
Miller suspects manipulation. He sees a threat where there is purpose.

Say:  
“Manipulation? No, marshal. Guidance. You see the shadows on the wall, but I see the light that casts them. In time, you will too.”
