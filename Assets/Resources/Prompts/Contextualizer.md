#### Generated Output

Miller, his voice heavy with the weight of unspoken doubts, questions the futility of their existence in the vast expanse of space. His pointed remarks linger uncomfortably, cutting through the haze of the dimly lit galley. Celeste, her hands trembling slightly, pours him another drink, her attempts at casual deflection betraying a growing unease. Each word seems to probe her carefully guarded composure, and she wonders: does Miller suspect her involvement in the Captain’s mysterious death? His sharp gaze suggests he’s testing her, inching closer to the truth. How much longer can Celeste deflect before Miller—or Julie—tears through her fragile façade?
